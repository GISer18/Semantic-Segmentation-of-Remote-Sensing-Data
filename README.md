# Semantic-Segmentation-of-Remote-Sensing-Data
(Work In Progress)
This repository contains python for dense semantic segmentation of remote sensing data using fully connected networks (FCN's). Thus far, it contains an implementation with Segnet (). It will also include FCN Resnet, U-Net, and the pyramid scene parsing network.
